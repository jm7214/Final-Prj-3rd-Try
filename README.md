 This is a webmap that can be used as a tool to review the designated landmarks on 3 islands located in New York Harbor. 
 The landmarks property information is from a LPC individual Landmark and Historic Preservation Building database on Open    Data. 
 
You will notice that the built date is not provided for the buildings. That is because the dataset shows all build dates as 1900 so I decided to leave that information out. Also the buildings are categorized by architecture type because that was the only column in the dataset that had enough types in common that could be categorized. 

The buildings have been set to extrude to give the 3D effect. I did not set the zoom and tilt to default to that view because I noticed that the buildings on these islands are relatively short and do not do the 3D effect justice. 

Overall, the site is pretty simple but it works. (as far as I know)
